# My Pack
Mypack is my final project for my software engineering boot camp, and a clone of the lighter pack app. My Pack is a full stack application that lets users make a gear list for their backpacking bags and calculate how much weight they will be carrying. The app shows the user the total weight of their pack, and each catagory within the pack. This information is displayed on a doughnut chart and in text. 

## technology
This app was build with:

    + React 
    + Ruby on Rails
    + Chart.js
    + CSS grid

### Planned features and bugs 

    Planned Features

        + Mobile display/ media queries
        + packing /check list for when your getting ready for a trip
        + Authentication/ multiple users, maybe every one can view all bags but only edit their own
        

    Bugs

        + Chart should update without having to hit the chart refresh button
        + Total pack weight should update without having to hit the chart refresh button
        + Sometimes the app will display/ flip between the current pack chart and previous pack's chart
